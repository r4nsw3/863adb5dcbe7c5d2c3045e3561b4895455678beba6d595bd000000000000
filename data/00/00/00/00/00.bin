  |                                                                         |
  |   Sid Meier's Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both     |
  |   Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based    |
  |   strategy classic to new heights. With 16 new civilizations, 18 new    |
  |   leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and    |
  |   an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new     |
  |   challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as    |
  |   exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Civilization VI Expansion Bundle contains all features from the   |
  |   Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, that includes:          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - NEW LEADERS AND CIVS: Combined together, sixteen new                |
  |   civilizations and eighteen new leaders are introduced. Each brings    |
  |   unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as unique units, districts,      |
  |   wonders, buildings, and more.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - GREAT AGES: As your civilization ebbs and flows and you reach       |
  |   milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or        |
  |   Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on   |
  |   your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your     |
  |   next Golden Age will be even stronger - a Heroic Age.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - LOYALTY: Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership -    |
  |   let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields,         |
  |   revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own   |
  |   independence. But one civilization's loss can be your gain as you     |
  |   inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand    |
  |   your borders.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - GOVERNORS: Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with   |
  |   unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your   |
  |   cities, and reinforce Loyalty.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - ENHANCED ALLIANCES: An enhanced alliances system allows players     |
  |   to form different types of alliances and build bonuses over time.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - EMERGENCIES: When a civilization grows too powerful, other          |
  |   civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization,   |
  |   and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - TIMELINE: Review your civilization's history at any time with the   |
  |   new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments   |
  |   that you encountered on your path to victory.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms,    |
  |   tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring     |
  |   the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are     |
  |   more important than ever as you balance high risks and high           |
  |   rewards.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES: Strategic resources play an         |
  |   additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants     |
  |   to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you'll be          |
  |   powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based         |
  |   resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also        |
  |   unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices      |
  |   about resource usage will directly affect the world's temperature     |
  |   and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - ENGINEERING PROJECTS: Shape the world around your empire to         |
  |   overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like      |
  |   canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider   |
  |   the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in     |
  |   the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to    |
  |   protect these tiles.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - WORLD CONGRESS: Make your voice heard among the other leaders of    |
  |   the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing       |
  |   city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic       |
  |   Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions,    |
  |   call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the      |
  |   weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic      |
  |   Victory.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICS: A new era has been added to     |
  |   the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects     |
  |   with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to      |
  |   seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon             |
  |   emissions.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
